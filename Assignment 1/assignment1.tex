\section{Schemata (0.5 pts)}
\textit{Consider the two schemata A1 = $\#0\#101\#\#\#$, A2 =
$\#\#010\#111$. Which of the two schemata has the highest chance to survive mutation, for a mutation rate $p_m$ = 0.01?} \\ 

The probability that a gene is not mutated is $(1-p_m)$. For a schema to survive, all genes that belong to it should survive. Using $o(S)$ as notation for the order of a schema, this leads to the following formula: $S_m(H)=(1-p_m)^{o(H)}$
This means that schema's with a low order are more likely to survive, as they have less genes that can be mutated.
Since $o(A1)=4$ and $o(A2)=6$, this means that $S_m(A1)=0.01^{4}=1e-8$ while $S_m(A2)=0.01(6)=1e-12$. A1 is more likely to survive therefore.

\section{Building Block Hypothesis (0.5 pts)}
\textit{Describe a problem where the Building Block Hypothesis does not hold.} \\

The building block hypothesis states that GA's step-wise generate solutions by combining several lower-order schemas (i.e. building blocks). This hypothesis does not hold for every problem: for example, a problem where the reward is 1 for one particular string of genes but 0 for every other gene. An example could be guessing a 4 digit pin-code, where each digits is represented with binary sequences. There is no gradient in the loss function or any other form of information available to guide the GA.

\section{Selection pressure (1 pts)}
\textit{Given the fitness function $f(x) = x^2$, calculate the probability of selecting the individuals $x = 2, x = 3, and x = 4,$ using roulette wheel selection. Calculate the probability of selecting the same individuals when the fitness function is scaled as follows $f_1 (x) = f (x) + 20$. Which fitness function yields a lower selection pressure? What can you conclude about the effect of fitness scaling on selection pressure?} \\ 

In roulette wheel selection, the probability of an individual being selected is proportional to the ratio of its own fitness and the sum of fitness of the entire population. Put in a formula, it is calculated as $p(s) = \dfrac{f_i}{\sum_i f_i}$. In the problem at hand, we have a population of 3 individuals. Their fitness and probabilities of being selected in roulette wheel selection are: \\
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    x    & Fitness  & p(s) \\ \hline \hline
    2    &  4       & 4/29 \\ \hline
    3    &  9       & 9/29 \\ \hline
    4    &  16      & 16/29 \\    
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fitness and probability of selection in roulette wheel selection for the function $f(x)=x^2$}
\end{table}

For the alternative fitness function $f_1 (x) = f (x) + 20$, there is a lower selection pressure which is shown by filling in the same table for $f_1(x)$:
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    x    & Fitness  & p(s) \\ \hline \hline
    2    &  24      & 24/89 \\ \hline
    3    &  29      & 29/89\\ \hline
    4    &  36      & 36/89 \\    
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fitness and probability of selection in roulette wheel selection for the function $f_1(x)=f(x)+20$}
\end{table}
With $f_1(x)$, the fitness scores are much closer to one another. This causes a lower selection pressure, as a small deviation in value of $x$ causes less difference in the probability of being selected.

\section{Role of selection in GA's (2 pts)}
The Counting Ones problem amounts to find a bit string whose sum of its entries is maximum. Implement a simple (1 + 1)-GA for solving the Counting Ones problem.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textit{Use bit strings of length $l = 100$ and a mutation rate $p = 1/l$. For a run of 1500 iterations, plot the best fitness against the elapsed number of iterations.}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Assignment 1/Figures/A1_4a.pdf}
        \caption{Convergence of (1+1) GA on Counting Ones problem}
        \label{fig:A1_4a}
    \end{figure}
    \item \textit{Now do 10 runs. How many times the algorithm finds the optimum?}
    The algorithm found the optimum 9/10 runs. With 100 runs, the algorithm found the optimum 92/100 runs. 
    \item \textit{Now replace (c) in the above algorithm with (c'): replace $x$ with $x_m$ . Is there a difference in performance when using this modification? Justify your answer} \\ 
    
    With the alteration, the GA performs a lot worse. The fitness of the determined solution fluctuates around the initial fitness. 0/10 runs have converged to the optimum. Repeating the experiment with 100 runs shows that 0/100 runs have converged. We can conclude that rule c is an important addition in the (1+1) GA algorithm, as the algorithm forgets the best solution found thus far otherwise.

\section{Evolutionary strategies vs local search (1 pts)}
\textit{Consider a (1+5) ES. How does this differ from the (1+1) ES in how the search space is explored when optimizing a function? How does the (1+$\lambda$) ES strategy behave with respect to the value of $\lambda$ when compared to greedy algorithms? } \\ 

A (1+5) ES algorithm represents a population where 1 member (the best) is chosen to survive to the next generation, in which 5 new children are initialized. The (1+5) ES is different from a (1+1) ES, because in a (1+1) ES at each iteration the best solution is kept and one child is added to the population. This means that if the child outperforms the parent, it replaces the parent. If the child does not outperform the parent, it is replaced by another child. As there is one child, at each time one direction of search in the real-valued vector space is explored.

Compared to a (1+5) ES there is a large difference, since there are now 5 children that can potentially replace the parent. At each iteration, the best of the 5 children and parent is chosen to be the new parent. With 5 children at each iteration, 5 directions of search in the real-valued vector space are explored.

Since ES are concerned with optimizing real valued vectors (such as weights), we can compare the optimization behaviour with standard hill-climbing methods such as greedy or gradient-descent. Whereas these methods \textit{always} take a step in the new direction, as (1+$\lambda$) ES only takes this step if the fitness of the step is actually improved. The higher the value of $\lambda$, the more informed the next step of the iteration becomes as more directions in the search space are explored. This can be advantageous, as this allows the algorithm to 'remember' certain solutions: it does not accidentally forget the best solution due to an unfortunate sequence of mutation, recombination and cross-over operations. However it can also cause the system to be more likely to be trapped in local optima/minima.
